# MultiPurpose
As the name implies it's a multi purpose app that will replace apps that I have been dissatisfied with in the past aswell as allowing me to bigger track my goals.


A multi purpose app that will replace Hardy, Samsung Notes and Forvo for us
On the FR part, you will put in the word you want to say and use AI to have voice recognition see if your pronunciation is good
On the Hardy part, it could be just like Hardy but better features and abilities
For Samsung Notes, it should be a mix of Google Docs and Sheets but not as clunky and overspaced
lean towards Docs 

## The 5 Main Things
There will be 5 main hubs(I might expand on it)
### LRNote - Note your thoughts
I want to make it similar to SamsungNotes, Google Docs and Sheets and use to it plan my life out to help with my ADHD. It will most likely feature a schedule aswell as a notes part.
### LangR - Language Learning(French in my case)
You will put in a word and the language that it is from, pronunce the word and then your voice will be analyzed to see any pronunciation defects. Additionally, I will consider adding a feature that allows you to just say that word and then it will be analzyed to see if you are able to correctly pronunce the word.
### MeaLR - Cooking
I plan to have a recipe features that has the macros and recommendations on other recipes based on what you have similar to the SuperCook Website
### LRSplit - Gym Tracking
A app similar to Hardy and Musclewiki, it will be a fusion of those that will help me track and add new exercises to my split

### Fifth
I am undecided but I am considering a schedule like feature
